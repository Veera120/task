CUDA Histogram Computation (Multithreaded & GPU-based)

This project implements **histogram calculation** 

- Sequential (CPU)
- Multithreaded (CPU)
- CUDA Kernel (GPU)

It compares the performance and verifies correctness of results across implementations.

Objective

> Develop a histogram computation using CUDA or multithreaded CPU solutions.  
> Provide performance comparisons and rigorous correctness checks against single-threaded versions.
