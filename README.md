# Matrix Class with Operator Overloading (C++)

This project implements a "Matrix class" in C++ using "templates". It supports:

- Matrix addition (`+`)
- Matrix subtraction (`-`)
- Matrix multiplication (`*`)
- Matrix printing (`<<`)

#  File Info
- `Task 1 Matrix Multiplication .cpp` â€” contains the matrix class and a test function and full version code.
# Features
1. Templated Matrix Class  
- Works with any data type like `int`, `float`

2.Overloaded Operators
- `+` for matrix addition
- `-` for matrix subtraction
- `*` for matrix multiplication
- `<<` to print matrix using `cout`

3.Function  
- `fillMatrix()` allows you to fill the matrix like:
   fillMatrix(A, {1, 2, 3, 4});

# Sample Output
Matrix A:
9 6
3 4
Matrix B:
2 4
7 8
A + B =
11 10
10 12

A - B =
7 2
-4 -4

A * B =
60 84
34 44
